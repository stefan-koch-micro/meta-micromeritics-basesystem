Note: Originally from the asus yocto build.
These files are required to flash the Yocto Linux OS to an attached
PE100A / IMX8P-IM-A using fastboot.

We follow the recovery mode for programming the boards by booting into
the serial download mode and then reflash the board from your host
computer as follows.

1. Power off the board and change the boot mode switches to serial download mode
  (Switch 1 : Switch 2 : Switch 3 : Switch 4) = (OFF : ON : OFF : ON)
2. Connect the USB Type-C cable to the USB Type-C ports on the board and your
   host computer.
3. Power on the board and the board should automatically boots into the
   serial download mode.
4. Make sure the driver is installed if the host computer is equipped with
   Windows.
5. Run the `flashall.cmd` script for Windows or `flashall.sh` for Linux in this
   directory.
6. When flashing is complete, your board will not boot up, because it stays in
   serial download mode. So please power off the board and reset the boot mode
   switch to eMMC mode then power on the board.
   (Switch 1 : Switch 2 : Switch 3 : Switch 4) = (ON : OFF : OFF : ON)

* The driver for Windows can installed from Microsoft Update automatically or
  local driver package manually.

* If you meet VCRuntime140.dll missing issue, please install Visual C++ Redistributable
