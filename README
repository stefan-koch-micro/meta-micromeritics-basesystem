This README file contains information on the contents of the meta-micromeritics-basesystem layer.

This layer defines the Micromeritics basesystem for the asus imx sbc.  This is the software that is
needed to install a specific instrument application onto the board.  It contains all the
Micromeritics specific functionality that we need for the basesystem.  The basesystem itself does
not include any specific application, but it does include the functionality to automatically install
an application (if none are installed, and if the properly fomratted usb stick is in place)

The main recipe is recipes-local/images/micromeritics-basesystem-image.bb.  This contains all the
base packages that are expected by all instrument applications.


It also installs all the micromeritics specific packages that are expected to be installed.  These
are in recipes-local/micro.  Currently these have:

1. mic-boot-chromium: a systemd service to start the mic-chromium in kiosk mode at boot time.  (The
   instrument application provides the content, so the boot block will give a not found error if the
   application is not installed.)
2. program-instrument: a custom service that runs at bootup that installs the instrument application
   if it is available on the usb stick, and there is no instrument app installed already.
3. micromeritics-kb-mouse-detection: does the keyboard and mouse detection that tells mic-chromium
   how to startup. 

The other recipes-local directories are for recipes or versions that are not available in the core
yocto packages provided, but that we wanted/needed for the application.

This setup allows ssh login to root with the password of "gE0R6!4". 

Finally, in the tools directory there are scripts to help with the build process.  See the README.md
there for more details.
